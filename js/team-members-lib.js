Panos received his Ph.D. degree from the Department of Computer Science Department of Stanford University for his work done with the Geometric Computing Lab under the supervision of Leo Guibas. Panos's research interests lie at the intersection of Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing. His area of focus is on designing deep learning models for visual data that emphasize semantic differences among objects, primarily as these are being expressed with natural language. A few years back Panos interned at the Facebook AI Research Lab in Menlo Park, and before that at Autodesk Research in San Francisco. He was a research assistant in the Haussler Lab at UCSC and an Erasmus scholar at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Tüebingen, DE.</p>
