    <b>Introduction</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    From molecules to social networks, graphs are ubiquitous in our daily lives, playing crucial roles
    in various applications. For example, users in a social network can be represented by their <a href="https://faculty.ucr.edu/~hanneman/nettext/C9_Ego_networks.html">ego-nets</a>, 
    molecules can be represented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_graph">graphs of atoms and bonds</a>, sentences can be
    represented by their <a href="https://www3.nd.edu/~dchiang/teaching/nlp/2018/slides/graph-grammars.pdf">semantic graphs</a>, etc. To better learn from graph data, graph neural
    networks (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_neural_network">GNNs</a>) have been developed and are commonly used for graph property prediction
    tasks, such as <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/task/graph-classification">graph classification</a>, in which we seek to map individual graphs to one or more
    labels. Nonetheless, there has been less focus on the area of graph regression with GNNs, which
    aims to directly predict numerical properties of the given graph such as a user’s age, a
    molecule’s melting point, etc.

  <p>
    In our recent paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12087">Semi-Supervised Graph Imbalanced Regression</a>, to be presented at <a href="https://kdd.org/kdd2023/">KDD 2023</a>, 
    we focus on the task of graph regression, and identified two major challenges in effectively 
    handling this task: (i) due to the high cost of human annotation, the amount of labeled training 
    data is usually very limited; (ii) the annotated data usually concentrates on small, yet popular 
    areas in the property spaces, making the distribution of the graph labels often severely 
    imbalanced (as illustrated in Figure 1). When trained with heavily imbalanced data, machine 
    learning models usually cannot make good predictions on minority labels as the training process 
    is biased towards the data with majority labels. In this work, we propose a novel semi-supervised 
    learning framework, named SGIR, for such imbalanced graph regression tasks. SGIR is a semi-supervised 
    learning framework that balances the label distribution in the training data by generating additional 
    labeled data from the unlabeled data. Our work provides both theoretical motivation and empirical 
    analysis for SGIR across seven diverse graph regression tasks. For example, on the <a href="https://moleculenet.org/datasets-1">FreeSolv</a> dataset 
    with only 276 labeled training graphs, SGIR achieved <strong>30%</strong> Mean Absolute Error (MAE) improvements in 
    the under-represented label range and <strong>12%</strong> MAE improvement overall compared to state-of-the-art graph 
    regression methods.

    <div class="caption"><b>Figure 2</b>: The SGIR Framework: A virtuous circle of self-training with 
      an imbalanced labeled dataset (upper-left). SGIR mainly consists three steps: (1) graph regression 
      with confidence for self-training (upper left -> lower left); (2) reverse sampling with the 
      prediction confidences (left column -> lower-middle -> upper-middle); (3) label-anchored 
      Mixup (middle column -> lower-right -> upper-right). Through these steps, the originally imbalanced 
      training data gradually get balanced by SGIR (upper-left -> upper-middle -> upper-right).</div>

  <p>
    SGIR is built based on <a href="https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/semi-supervised-learning/">self-training</a>, which is a training scheme to increase the labeled training set
    by adding pseudo labels for unlabeled data. Specifically, it involves first training a model that
    iteratively assigns pseudo-labels to the set of unlabeled training examples with higher
    confidences, and uses these confidences to place them into the labeled training set in the
    subsequent iteration. Figure 2 presents the high-level design of SGIR, which enriches the labeled
    training set by two steps: generating pseudo-labels for unlabeled data and then data
    augmentation. We hypothesize that with the balanced training set generated by SGIR, the GNN
    model can be trained with less bias towards the label majority and reach an overall better
    prediction.

    <b>Graph Regression with Confidence</b>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Unlike classification models which give label predictions in addition to confidence scores
    (normalized logit values after softmax), regression models only output their predictions, which
    poses a big challenge for using self-training on regression tasks. In this work, we take advantage
    of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02886.pdf">graph rationalization</a> to get the confidences for the graph regression model’s predictions.
    Specifically, the graph rationalization model separates each given graph into two parts when
    making the prediction: a “rationale” subgraph that correlates with the task label, and the ambient
    “environment” subgraph which is inferred to be unrelated to the label. With the rationale and
    environment subgraphs, we measure the confidence of graph property prediction based on the
    reliability of the identified rationale subgraphs. Specifically, we use the variance of model
    predictions from the combination of one rationale subgraph with multiple different environment
    subgraphs as the indicator of the prediction confidence. Low variance indicates that the model
    can make consistent predictions for the same rationale subgraph with different environment
    subgraphs, signifying that the rationalization step successfully identified a high-quality rationale
    subgraph. Consequently, these predictions are more likely to be accurate compared to those
    with high variance (i.e., low-quality rationale subgraph).
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p class="sub-section">
    <b>Reverse Sampling</b>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    With the confidences from the rationalization as described above, we pick the unlabeled data
    with high confidence predictions to enrich the labeled training data, with the predictions being
    their pseudo-labels. We use reverse sampling to selectively add unlabeled examples that are
    predicted to be in the under-represented label ranges. That is, we first invert the imbalanced data
    distribution and then use it to sample from the high confidence predictions (dashed arrow in the
    left half of Figure 2). As shown in the lower-left plot and the middle column of Figure 2, we
    reverse the imbalanced training label distribution, use it to sample from the high confidence
    predictions, and add those examples G conf with their pseudo-labels back to the training data.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p class="sub-section">
    <b>Label-anchored Mixup</b>
  </p>

  <p>
    In practical applications, we noticed that even with the reverse sampling described above, the
    label imbalance issue usually still cannot be fully resolved, as illustrated in the upper-middle plot
    in Figure 2. The reasons are twofold: (i) the unlabeled data is similarly imbalanced as the labeled
    training data, such that we may not have enough high-confidence pseudo-labels for the under-represented 
    label ranges; (ii) the original model trained with imbalanced data is more likely to be
    biased towards the majority label ranges, such that it struggles to give high confidence
    predictions on the under-represented label ranges due to inherent bias in the raw data. Both of
    these reasons would lead to insufficient samples with high confidence predictions in the under-represented 
    label ranges. Therefore, we utilize a label-anchored Mixup algorithm to further
    balance the training data via augmentation. Mixup is a common data augmentation technique to
    generate new labeled training examples by interpolating pairs of existing ones. With our 
    label-anchored Mixup, we target the under-represented label ranges and compensate for the label
    imbalance, as illustrated in the right-most column in Figure 2.

    <b>Results</b>
  </p>

  <p>
    We evaluated our approach on public benchmark datasets, which are mainly from the molecular and image domains. Figure 3 shows the molecular property prediction performance on three benchmarks in terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and geometric mean (GM) in different label regions, where many-shot, med.-shot, and few-shot indicate the purple, yellow, and red regions in Figure 1, respectively. Compared with other imbalanced regression and semi-supervised graph learning baselines, our proposed SGIR consistently achieves best performances across datasets as it's able to enrich and balance the training data with confidently predicted pseudo-labels and augmentation. Additionally, the improvements from SGIR in the under-represented label ranges are achieved without sacrificing the performance in the well-represented label ranges.

    <b>Conclusion</b>
  </p>

  <p>
    Our work explored graph imbalanced regression tasks and improved semi-supervised learning for this area. We introduced a self-training framework SGIR that gradually reduced model bias caused by data imbalance through reverse sampling and augmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of SGIR on improving the performance on under-represented label ranges without sacrificing that of the well-represented label ranges..
